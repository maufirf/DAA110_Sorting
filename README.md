# DAA110_Sorting
An assignment given from our Algorithm Design and Analysis lecturer, about sorting.

------

No we didn't use Matlab, we use Octave.
To run this project after cloning it, just go to your terminal and type
```
octave main.m --no-gui
```

Make sure the Octave MINGW64 or MINGW32 bin path is listed in your system `PATH` environment variable for windows user.

Quick explanation:

- `main.m` is basically the main script file.
- `boseMain.m` is the function file that acts as handler for bose-nelson sort
- `boseNetGen.m` is the sorting network generator for the `boseMain.m`
- `heapMain.m` is the function file that acts as handler for heap sort
- `stalinMain.m` is the same, but for Stalin sort
- `thanosMain.m` is the same, but for Thanos sort
and the rest of the files are just experiment craters.
